    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  				<p class="bodyTextType2" id="titleDetailsText">Each year during the school’s Homecoming Carnival, the Boyertown Area Senior High School TSA runs a stand selling food, fun, and opportunities to win prizes. For the price of a few tickets, carnival-goers can eat hot dogs or walking tacos, or even enjoy a cold water or soda. The stand consisted of TSA members volunteering time after school and into the evening to make food, handle tickets, and enjoy the festivities.<br><br>
							In the week leading up to the Homecoming game, the entire school participated in Spirit Week, and the BASH TSA Chapter was not afraid to sport their school pride! Members participated in America Monday, Tacky Tourist Day, [Holiday Day?], [thursday?], and [Class day?], and worked tirelessly to develop fun games and prizes for the yearly carnival.<br><br>
							TSA’s representation at the carnival cemented its image to students, staff, and the community that it is more than just a technology club. While winning awards at the regional, state, and national levels can turn local heads, simply showing the community compassion by offering a cold drink also makes a powerful statement. Wherever there is a chance to lift spirits and stir up some fun in the local area, BASH TSA is always there!

			  		<div class="row">
    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  				<p class="bodyTextType2" id="titleDetailsText">In early December, BASH TSA hosts a yearly spaghetti buffet to friends and families of TSA members, as well as teachers, people of the community, and even school board members. The all-you-can-eat dinner includes mouth-watering spaghetti, a side salad, fluffy buttered rolls, a variety of drinks, and a delicious assortment of homemade desserts. At $10 a meal, including to-go boxes, it is always a bargain and a decent fundraiser for community and TSA members.<br><br>
							TSA students are encouraged to sell as many tickets as they can in the weeks leading up to the event, though tickets can also be bought at the door. Profits from pre-sold tickets go directly to individuals to finance their trip to the state conference in April. By offering this fundraising opportunity, BASH TSA allows students to more effectively find the necessary funds. With a love of technology comes a love of giving the best opportunities to student who pursue it, and because of this, the BASH TSA Spaghetti Dinner is always a huge success.

			  		<div class="row">
    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  				<p class="bodyTextType2" id="titleDetailsText">At the suggestion of the 2016-17 fundraising committee, BASH TSA developed a bag bingo night for addition fundraising for the state conference. By selling tickets ahead of time, the event was practically [was it?] sold out within a few weeks. On the day of, students joined together to make and serve food through donations, help run the event itself, and clean up afterwards. Many vendors brought their wares to the bingo night, creating a busy, successful atmosphere that lasted the entire evening. A portion of the profits went to each student who volunteered their time to run the event. 
			  				<br><br>
							BASH TSA strives to enable students to pursue their love of technology and refuses to let any financial difficulties get in the way of that passion. A commitment to the finding and founding of fundraising opportunities defines and elevates success at BASH TSA.

			  		<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-8">
			  				<p class="bodyTextType2" id="titleDetailsText">To drum up some hype within the club, a Painting With A Twist party was organized near the beginning of the year. Members enjoyed an evening of creative expression, snacks, and fellowship, including participating in social media and painting competitions. Getting together to paint reinforced friendship as not only a chapter, but as a team. Students became closer with old pals and made new connections while laughing and socializing outside of the technology education rooms. An important part of success as a TSA chapter is the unity between members, and BASH TSA always makes sure of this.</p>
