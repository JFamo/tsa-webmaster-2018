Sold as numerous different models, Alexa can 	come in a standard speaker system such as the Echo and Echo Plus, a miniature speaker for a cheaper price known as the Echo dot, and a high-quality LCD display with speakers beneath on the Echo Show to show the user information. Alexa is designed with the Amazon web store in mind and is built around online shopping. Some of its major functions allow you to quickly shop with your voice, play music through Amazon music and Spotify, and give news and weather updates. Amazon releases new versions of Alexa on an almost annual basis, continually causing the AI-based smart home movement to grow.</p>

The Google Assistant is built in to any Android-Stock version of Android, but can be downloaded by way of an application to any iOS device, or device running a Skinned version of Android. Google Assistant allows you to play music, youtube videos, and make Google Searches just with your voice. It is an emblem of where Google thinks the future of the Smart-World is headed, and Google is commercializing this product as much as it can.</p>

Within 2018, Apple is also planning on releasing the Apple Homepod, a device that will work as a speaker within one’s house, similar to that of Alexa. Siri serves mainly as a hub to entertain and perform basic hands-free tasks, such as playing music, opening apps, calling a contact, or making a Google search. Siri was the first mainstream and largescale commercialized AI system that millions began to use and remember virtually overnight. It set the industry standard for what AI in your pocket was supposed to be.</p>

Cortana was originally developed for the Windows Phone and still resides there to this day, however, its main platform is the PC on the Windows 10 OS. Cortana can be found on any Windows computer running Windows 10, making it easily the most owned AI system, considering the fact that over 70% of current computers run Windows 10. Cortana does similar things to the other AI systems mentioned, but it is often underutilized <b>(SOURCE???)</b> due to the lack of need for a personal assistant on a desktop or laptop computer. Either way, the fact that it is the most downloaded commercialized AI should not go unnoticed.</p>

    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">A chatbot is an interactive program in which the user conversates with an AI, which responds in a human like manner. They can range from complex everyday conversation to short commands like those used for Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. When anyone mentions a chatbot, however, the former type comes to mind. These robots started off with ones like A.L.I.C.E., created by Dr. Richard Wallace in 1995. One of the first to go online, this bot still holds its own today and creates conversation remarkably well for its age. 
<br>There is a test available to grade these conversational chatbots: The Alan Turing Test. It was proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 to determine whether a computer could think. The criteria was simple, and yet complicated: if an AI could act, react, and interact with user input like a sentient being, than that AI was sentient. The test is done with a human interrogator who must figure out whether they are chatting with an AI or a human subject in a given time frame by examining responses to certain questions. No bot has been able to pass the test so far, though the most recent bot to have come close was Eugene Goostman (2014), a representation of a thirteen year old Ukrainian boy. This bot managed to fool 10/30 judges in the University of Reading that it was human, though when analyzed carefully, it is far from being truly “sentient”. Professionals believe that such a feat will not occur until 2029, or even later than that. </p>

			  		<div class="row">
    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Autodesk, a 3D modeling company famous for producing software like Maya and Fusion 360, has recently created a new way for engineers to innovate solutions to modern world problems. Through the use of “generative design”, architects and engineers can work with AI systems and cloud computers to generate thousands of solutions to structural issues and produce the best model for any situation through a supported medium, like Autodesk’s Within or Dreamcatcher software. The user inputs certain parameters and goals, including material, type, weight, strength, and cost restrictions. The generative AI, with the help of cloud computing, can then calculate possible permutations for a design solution, and in the process can even conduct a performance analysis on each of these. The user and the AI then choose the best design that solves the issue at hand and build it in real life.
<br>An example for the use of such a technique includes the creation of a partition to be used between a passenger compartment and a galley on an A320 Plane by Airbus. It needed to be very strong, with the ability to hold two flight attendants during take-offs and landings, and it needed to be very light, as Airbus was trying to lighten the plane as much as possible for faster flights. On top of those requirements, a cutoff had to exist in the center of it to pass items to and from the cabin. Using generative AI, Airbus engineers created the “bionic partition”, a partition model that resembles a combination of mammal bone and slime mold structure. This bizarre looking, lattice structure design actually cut the weight of the partition by half from before, and managed to make it significantly stronger as well. Thus, the generative design process did not just solve the issue at hand, it also made the partition more efficient to produce, cost-effective, and environment-friendly. The new design will be seen in A320 commercial planes in 2018 - this year.</p>

			  		<p class="titleTextType2">Advanced Scheduling Assistants</p>
			  		<div class="row">
    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">AI like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa can only go so far when it comes to interacting with other people: they can call or text others certain messages that the user must specify. Certain scheduling assistants exist in the market today and are being improved upon to help people assign meetings and interact with colleagues and coworkers to reach end goals; almost like your own artificial secretary. 
Meet Amy and Andrew Ingram, autonomous AIs by x.ai that have been worked on to mimic the everyday secretary: they can read and prepare a schedule for you every day, and based on that schedule, can set up meetings with whomever you wish. It works very naturally, all you have to do is send Amy/Andrew a CC copy of an email telling them what you want done and with whom. Amy/Andrew will then send emails to the people you wish to meet and will negotiate a time depending on your schedule. For example, say a manager needed to schedule several 30 minute interviews with his or her employees. He or she would send an email to all of them (including a CC copy to Amy or Andrew) talking about the interview, asking Amy or Andrew at the end to set up a date. The bot will, in response, talk to all of the selected employees about scheduling the interview, making sure to find a time that fit their schedule as well as that of the manager.  Of course, Amy/Andrew would finalize meeting plans with you at the end, however, by allowing Amy or Andrew to deal with these types of tedious, cumbersome tasks, lots of time can be saved for productive work.
