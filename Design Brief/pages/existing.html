			  		<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Commercialized artificial intelligence is the basic group of artificial intelligence systems that are being heavily pushed onto people at this time and are generally used to help people build smarthomes. For example, the main commercialized AI at this point are Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google’s Google 		Assistant and Google Home, and Microsoft’s Cortana. These technologies and products are the most dynamic force behind the push for more commercial artificial intelligence. They are relatively basic 	compared to what some AI are capable of, but they are paving the way for advanced artificial intelligence to make it into every home just a few years from today.</p>

    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Alexa is a unique AI system that is sold by Amazon. Sold as numerous different models, Alexa can 	come in a standard speaker system such as the Echo and Echo Plus, a miniature speaker for a cheaper price known as the Echo dot, and a high-quality LCD display with speakers beneath on the Echo Show to show the user information. Alexa is designed with the Amazon web store in mind and is built around online shopping. Some of its major functions allow you to quickly shop with your voice, play music through Amazon music and Spotify, and give news and weather updates. Amazon releases new versions of Alexa on an almost annual basis, continually causing the AI-based smart home movement to grow.</p>

			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">The Google Assistant is a personal assistant that was originally designed to compete with Siri, however presently mainly competes with Amazon’s Alexa through the Google Home and the Google Home mini. The Google Assistant is built in to any Android-Stock version of Android, but can be downloaded by way of an application to any iOS device, or device running a Skinned version of Android. Google Assistant allows you to play music, youtube videos, and make Google Searches just with your voice. It is an emblem of where Google thinks the future of the Smart-World is headed, and Google is commercializing this product as much as it can.</p>

			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Apple’s Siri is an intelligent personal assistant that can be found on all major Apple products including iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Mac OS X, and even the Apple Watch. Within 2018, Apple is also planning on releasing the Apple Homepod, a device that will work as a speaker within one’s house, similar to that of Alexa. Siri serves mainly as a hub to entertain and perform basic hands-free tasks, such as playing music, opening apps, calling a contact, or making a Google search. Siri was the first mainstream and largescale commercialized AI system that millions began to use and remember virtually overnight. It set the industry standard for what AI in your pocket was supposed to be.</p>

			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">In the quartet of Technology Giants, Microsoft’s Cortana AI system often goes forgotten. Cortana was originally developed for the Windows Phone and still resides there to this day, however, its main platform is the PC on the Windows 10 OS. Cortana can be found on any Windows computer running Windows 10, making it easily the most owned AI system, considering the fact that over 70% of current computers run Windows 10. Cortana does similar things to the other AI systems mentioned, but it is often underutilized <b>(SOURCE???)</b> due to the lack of need for a personal assistant on a desktop or laptop computer. Either way, the fact that it is the most downloaded commercialized AI should not go unnoticed.</p>
