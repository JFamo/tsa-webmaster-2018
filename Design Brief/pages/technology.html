			  		<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Artificial intelligence is made up of numerous sub-categories of advanced technologies. All of these technologies in use, are generally considered artificial intelligence by themselves, but it is the use of these technologies together that will really advance the whole of artificial intelligence to the next level. Artificial intelligence is here to stay, and these technologies will only become more and more prevalent in the lives of people, and the world around them.</p>

			  		<div class="row">
    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  				<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">As artificial intelligence becomes more mainstream, people who are not as “computer-savvy” still need to be able to understand how to communicate with the AI and computers as a whole. This is where voice dictation, or speech recognition, comes in. Voice Dictation is the ability for a computer to recognize what the user is saying, and translate it into Machine Language that the computer itself is capable of understanding. This technology is already in use in conjunction with voice response in numerous different products such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google’s Google Assistant. Other companies that specialize in voice dictation include Nice and Verint Systems. Being such an important step to the rise of AI, it makes sense that voice dictation has been so quickly and effortlessly pushed onto the consumer market, and used extensively within private platforms.</p>

			  		<p class="titleTextType2">Machine Learning</p>
			  		<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Machine learning is one of the largest roots to artificial intelligence. The idea of computers learning in order to improve their capabilities is one of the most fascinating technologies within the artificial intelligence family. Machine learning is done primarily through algorithms and application programming interfaces that are generally designed to analyze data at this stage of AI. As the data is analyzed, the computer is able to “learn” about whatever data it is analyzing by identifying patterns that it deems “successful”. The AI is able to look for trends within these successful patterns to mimic them. This use of machine learning is used in order to predict future trends based off the successful patterns of data it has analyzed. Leading companies in this field include Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, who all use this to redirect company ideas based on large quantities of data (i.e. Google Trends).</p>

			  		<div class="row">
    					<div class="col-sm-8">
			  				<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Virtual agents are the most commonly thought of version of artificial intelligence. A virtual agent is a type of computer program that is designed to interact with humans. Chatbots are a well-known and popular style of virtual agent. There are however, other very important current uses for virtual agents. For example, many companies are beginning to use virtual agents as customer service responders when they are called over the phone. They are also commonly used to manage different functions and features of smart-homes. They generally have access to complex functions and are able to dumb-down options to make it simpler for humans to use. Companies that are currently working on development of advanced virtual agents include Creative Virtual, Assist AI, Artificial Solutions, and IBM.</p>

			  		<p class="titleTextType2">Natural Language Processing</p>
			  		<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Natural Language processing is the use of text-based analytics by computer systems in order to learn different natural languages. A natural language is a language that has developed naturally in use, such as English or Spanish. Through a mixture of analytics and Machine Learning, Natural Language processors are able to learn and understand proper sentence structure along with the meaning of the sentence structure and the words themselves. This has numerous purposes. Not only does it advance some of the other AI technologies such as voice dictation and virtual agents, but it allows communicating with computers to be done all in English. It can also be used to analyze security systems, detect fraudulent writing, and sort through and organize large arrays of unstructured data. Some companies that are developing Natural Language processors are Coveo, Knime, and Basis Technology.</p>

			  				<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">The goal of biometrics is to make interactions between humans and machines more seamless and natural. This includes all means of communication between the two through touch recognition (touch-based communication), image communication, speech recognition, and body language recognition (the use of gestures as means to communicate with an artificial intelligence. Vendors that are currently trying to incorporate this technology into mainstream AI include 3VR, FaceFirst, Synqera, and Affectiva. Pushing the limits of biometric technologies creates limitless possibilities of what AI computer systems will be able to do to impact the lives of humanity.</p>

			  		<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Similar to Machine learning, Deep Learning Platforms (DLP's) are a type of machine learning that is used by creating numerous artificial neural networks with many layers of abstraction in each neural network. These neural networks are then used to recognize and predict patterns when given very large sets of data to read and use. Also used within Classification Applications for the same purpose. DLP’s are able to interpolate and extrapolate data in order to provide accurate results for a measured set of data, and generate equations to extrapolate the potential of specific data in the future. DLP’s can also be used to recognize trend changes in data and predict future trend changes.</p>

			  				<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">With the extreme rise in Artificial Intelligence ability within the last few years, standard computers are starting to not become optimized to run high end AI which is being pushed recently. Because of this, AI based hardware has started to become popular. AI based hardware is hardware that is designed for a specific AI to run with no compromises. This hardware cuts out any functions a normal computer might have that the AI doesn’t need, and adds extra power and functions that the AI does need. This allows the AI to run in an optimized state, pushing the boundaries of AI. The Graphics Processor or GPU is the computer part that is most commonly engineered specifically for AI because of its versatility, however, all computer parts can be designed specifically with AI in mind.</p>

Decision Management is technology based off of the idea that computers can use large data analysis to make smarter decisions backed by more data than humans can. Rules and logic are coded into AI systems and are used to “train” the AI. The AI is continually maintained and “retuned” to what is going on in the world. All of this technology is generally used in enterprise applications in order to make automated decisions.</p>

			  				<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Robotic process automation or RPA is the basis of replacing human jobs with computers. This is usually done by writing scripts for specific AI to perform human action in a more efficient manner. RPA is usually used to speed up business production and make the business more profitable. As of now, these technologies do not replace most human jobs. RPA only replaces jobs that are extremely expensive and inefficient to have run by humans. This is because RPA’s themselves are extremely costly, and for most jobs, just having humans do them is much cheaper and more cost-effective. Some companies that currently use RPA include Automation Anywhere, UIPath, and WorkFusion.</p>
