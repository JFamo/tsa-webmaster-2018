			  				<p class="bodyTextType2" id="titleDetailsText">Last February, and for hopefully many years to come, BASH-TSA participated in a Relay for Life walk to support our national philanthropy, the American Cancer Society. At Moravian College, fifteen students walked on April 7th, 2017 for BASH-TSAâ€™s very first Relay for Life walk. The experience brought awareness to the community, school, and chapter. The students who walked enjoyed the experience and the opportunity to talk to students from other chapters, clubs, and schools in the area. 
<br>BASH-TSA looks forward to participating in more Relay for Life walks and encouraging other chapters to join in as well.

			  				To raise money for the American Cancer Society, BASH-TSA sold t-shirts in the week leading up to a school pep rally. Every day at lunch, during every period, BASH-TSA members setup shop at a table in the lunch room and vended shirts to fellow students. The shirts encouraged a blue-out for Men's Prostate Cancer awareness. Many shirts were sold, and the chapter anticipates being able to make a sizeable donation at the end of the year. The two year total for the event raised $8,853. BASH-TSA was able to not only make a large donation to men's prostate cancer research, but also banded together with BASH Student Council to raise awareness for their yearly MiniThon event.</p>

			  				<p class="bodyTextType2" id="titleDetailsText">For the past three years, BASH-TSA has run a successful school-wide clothing drive. The event collected twelve hundred pounds of clothing in the 2015-16 year. In fact, advisors and student leaders expected only one truck load of clothing, but the entire chapter was ecstatic when a second trip to Virginia and back was necessary! In total, BASH-TSA has collected more than $2000 worth, which is measured per pound of clothes. This fundraiser prompts students, teachers, and families to clean out their closets and get organized for a cause. BASH-TSA frequently exhibits its commitment to finding new and innovative ways to raise money for charity and maximize chapter, school, and community participation.
