He went to Millersville University for both his bachelor’s degree in Technology Education and master’s in Elementary Education. He teaches classes such as Tech and Engineering, Architecture Design and Robotics. Mr. Roth is interested in all things engineering (especially robotics) and he decided to teach these classes specifically because of the nice spin on engineering they provide. He uses technology in the classroom to help engage students, make the concepts that are taught relevant and to prepare students for jobs outside of high school that are reliant on technology.

Holding a bachelor’s degree in Industrial Arts Education and a master’s in Woodworking and Furniture Design, Mr. Burton teaches classes such as Residential Construction, Engineering Materials and Material Technology because he likes sharing how to make things. As far as technology’s role in education, Mr. Burton is deeply concerned we are raising a generation of people that do not know how to do anything, and he is trying to combat that.

TSA students are able to design, build, test, and create innovative solutions to TSA event problems while having an excellent community of peers to work with, get ideas from, and to give and receive help on a daily basis. This FLEX is an ideal way to keep events on track, and to use school time wisely to stay ahead on their projects. Students in the TSA homeroom will automatically be placed into the TSA FLEX.</p>

In the club, students with an aptitude for the sciences compete at an olympiad competition, which offers a variety of science-related events. Members of the club will meet after school to prepare for their events with their teams, and gain a more in-depth understanding of STEM topics than their normal classes may offer. Some areas of competition include anatomy and physiology, cell biology, ecology and fossils.</p>

Students who have an interest and ability with computers are able to receive training from the school’s IT department, and then will be working with fellow classmates and staff members to support their technology needs and help trouble shoot problems. There is the potential to turn this into an internship as well as receive credit on their transcripts.</p>

They fundraise for their club by selling Gertrude Hawk chocolate, and the club gives them an opportunity to complete their job shadow early - a requirement for graduation at Boyertown. Events include business events, technology events, and a quizbowl.</p>
