Alexa is designed with the Amazon web store in mind and is built around online shopping. Some of its major functions allow you to quickly shop with your voice, play music through Amazon music and Spotify, and give news and weather updates.

Cortana does similar things to the other AI systems mentioned, but it is often underutilized - used by only 15.8% of users, according to a survey by Stone Temple Consulting. The same survey found that Cortana is the most accurate of the top four personal assistants, boasting a 93.0% accuracy rate.

			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">A chatbot is an interactive program in which the user conversates with an AI, which responds in a human like manner. They can range from complex everyday conversation to short commands like those used for Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. When anyone mentions a chatbot, however, the former type comes to mind. These robots started off with ones like A.L.I.C.E., created by Dr. Richard Wallace in 1995. One of the first to go online, this bot still holds its own today and creates conversation remarkably well for its age. 
<br><br>
There is a test available to grade these conversational chatbots: The Alan Turing Test. It was proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 to determine whether a computer could think. The criteria was simple, and yet complicated: if an AI could act, react, and interact with user input like a sentient being, than that AI was sentient. The test is done with a human interrogator who must figure out whether they are chatting with an AI or a human subject in a given time frame by examining responses to certain questions. No bot has been able to pass the test so far, though the most recent bot to have come close was Eugene Goostman (2014), a representation of a thirteen year old Ukrainian boy. This bot managed to fool 10/30 judges in the University of Reading that it was human, though when analyzed carefully, it is far from being truly “sentient”. Professionals believe that such a feat will not occur until at least the year 2029.

			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">A 3D modeling company called AutoDesk has recently created a new way for engineers to innovate solutions to modern world problems. Through the use of “generative design”, architects and engineers can work with AI systems and cloud computers to generate thousands of solutions to structural issues and produce the best model for any situation through mediums like Autodesk’s Dreamcatcher software. The user inputs certain parameters, including material, type, weight, strength, and cost restrictions. The AI, through cloud computations, can then calculate possible permutations for a design solution, and in the process, even conduct a performance analysis on each of these. The user and the AI can then choose the best design that solves the issue at hand to be built in real life.
<br><br>
An example for the use of such a technique includes the creation of a partition to be used between a passenger compartment and a galley on an A320 Plane by Airbus. It needed to be very strong and very light, as Airbus was trying to lighten the plane as much as possible for faster flights. Also, a cutoff had to exist in the center of it to pass items to and from the cabin. Using generative AI, Airbus engineers created the “bionic partition”, a partition model that resembles a combination of mammal bone and slime mold structure. This bizarre looking, lattice structure design actually cut the weight of the partition by half from before, and made it significantly stronger as well. The process did not just solve the issue at hand, it also made the partition more efficient to produce, cost-effective, and environment-friendly.

			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">AI like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa can only go so far when it comes to interacting with other people: they can call or text others certain messages that the user must specify. Certain scheduling assistants exist in the market today and are being improved upon to help people assign meetings and interact with colleagues and coworkers to reach end goals; almost like your own artificial secretary.<br>
Meet Amy and Andrew Ingram, autonomous AIs by x.ai that have been worked on to mimic the everyday secretary: they can read and prepare a schedule for you every day, and based on that schedule, can set up meetings with whomever you wish. It works very naturally, all you have to do is send Amy/Andrew a CC copy of an email telling them what you want done and with whom. Amy/Andrew will then send emails to the people you wish to meet and will negotiate a time depending on your schedule. For example, say a manager needed to schedule several 30 minute interviews with his or her employees. He or she would send an email to all of them (including a CC copy to Amy or Andrew) talking about the interview, asking Amy or Andrew at the end to set up a date. The bot will, in response, talk to all of the selected employees about scheduling the interview, making sure to find a time that fit their schedule as well as that of the manager.  Of course, Amy/Andrew would finalize meeting plans with the manager at the end, but allowing Amy or Andrew to deal with these types of tedious, cumbersome tasks, lots of time can be saved for productive work.

			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Watson is a peculiar AI system, most similar to Autodesk’s generative design AI. Watson’s primary function is to provide answers to complex solutions in almost any professional field, based off of a bank of over 200 million pages of information, all of which increases over time and through experience. Watson, as a “trivial” way in proving itself, played Jeopardy against champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011 and beat them. What was most impressive about this showing was the bot’s ability to understand complex human language, something few AI systems today can accomplish. 
<br>Watson is improving itself all the time by processing information like a normal human: it observes, interprets, and evaluates information everywhere around the web, whether it be from articles, blog posts, or tweets. Professionals using Watson can then sort through which information to “ingest” and which to remove (either due to inaccuracy or irrelevancy). With this huge bank of information, professionals ranging from doctors to chemists to financial analysts can ask Watson to solve complex problems, or at least produce permutations of solutions. IBM claims that this in turn will enhance professional capability, allowing doctors to give more accurate diagnoses or financialists to think of better investment plans. The more Watson is used, the better it gets, and perhaps one day, it may help discover technological or medical breakthroughs, like the cure for currently incurable diseases.

			  			<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Hanson Robotics is one of the biggest leaders in the AI Robotics Industry, with functional, lifelike, companion bots. These bots are humanoid and have human faces that show emotion through high quality expressions and artistic facial animations. The faces have a “Frubber” (flesh rubber) exterior and eyes that make contact with the user when in conversation. Hanson’s goal is to create AI companions that “teach, serve, entertain” and “truly understand and care about humans”. By implementing friendly human ethics into their general AIs, Hanson plans to one day evolve these robot companions into super intelligent, fully autonomous beings that roam the Earth alongside people. The company’s bots have been featured in a wide array of media outlets, like the New York Times, CNN, and BBC, and are highly praised for their interactivity. What makes these bots unique from assistants like Siri and Alexa is not only this interactivity, which includes playing games or teaching, but also by holding conversations and possessing personality. A cloud-based AI known as “MindCloud” is what runs all of Hanson’s robots, which is being improved upon constantly through user interaction. Some of Hanson’s most popular bots include Sophia, Professor Einstein, and Philip K. Dick.
