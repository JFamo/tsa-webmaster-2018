Using facial recognition and cognitive natural speech interpretation, Plexor can be a servant, assistant, or even a companion. Plexor will return to its own charging station when low on power, and requires only a WiFi connection. It is also able to connect to devices throughout your house using smart outlets, smart locks, and smart lights, allowing you to set a schedule for managing your home. Even without programming, Plexor's intelligence allows it to predict user commands and adjust home settings accordingly.</p>

Using generative AI, designers can choose between thousands, or even millions, of design solutions to complex problems. These solutions are created by the AI quickly with the help of cloud computing, narrowing the designs down to those that help solve the given problem in the best way possible. With AI, efficiency and perfection can be emphasized in technological / architectural design.</p>

			  				<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">The most common AI, such as Google Assistant, Siri, or Alexa, were built with convenience in mind. Whether it be to ask for the weather, or to shut off the lights in the house, AI can make it easier for people to do all the small things in life, especially when connected to a “smart” home. Texting, calling, sending emails, scheduling, and all other tasks are made easier through mobile or internal AI (like Amy and Andrew from x.ai). Searching facts on Google, looking up a recipe saved from before, or listening to the news are all features that take more time without an AI assistant, as pulling out or finding a mobile device, going on certain apps, and typing information is a lot slower than asking Alexa, “Can my dog eat a cucumber?” To top it off, companies like Google, Tesla, Uber, Toyota, and many others have been hard at work creating driverless AI cars, which will in the not-so-distant future make travel more convenient and safe than ever before. </p>

			  		<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">When searching anything on Google or browsing through movies in Netflix, AI and algorithms are used to figure out what the user likes or prefers to search up. Thus, companies are able to provide advertisements that are relevant to the user’s interest, increasing his or her likelihood of clicking on it. In the case of Netflix or Youtube, they can recommend videos or movies that are more relevant to the user, increasing his or her watch-time. This, in turn, benefits both the user and the companies behind the advertisements / services. Additionally, AI like chatbots are becoming common in customer support services, drawing upon millions and millions of conversations and phone calls to help understand language and better serve customers.

			  				<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">AI helps improve experiences in social media and regulate the mass amounts of texts and posts sent every day. Facebook uses neural networks to power “facial recognition”, which goes through photos and identifies the people in them. Apple’s iOS does a similar thing in its Photos application, which helps the user create digital albums based off the people he or she chooses to include. As mentioned earlier, AI helps Facebook and Instagram provide advertisements that are better suited to the users’ interests, which in turn earns the companies money. Some AI, like that from DeepText, can read texts and posts and understand their concepts and intents. Using this, social networks can automate the removal of spam, help users discover new profiles based on their interests, and allow public figures the ability to sift through comments that are relevant to their posts.</p>

Too, the bot can help doctors diagnose patients and prescribe treatments. AI can map out surgery plans and suggest procedures to surgeons. Chatbots can help answer questions from patients and schedule appointments. The goal for the use of such AI is to improve the patients’ outcome while reducing the cost of said outcome. </p>

Through machine learning, algorithms are beginning to dig through and integrate themselves in analytics and CRM platforms to better serve customers. Advertising products, as discussed earlier, is far easier thanks to AI that help locate potentially interested customers.

			  		<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">Many companies use AI for security, such as Deep Instinct for detecting malware, or PayPal for preventing money laundering. With the recent increase in “smart” homes and electronic devices connected to some network or another, more and more threats are being posed by skilled hackers. When these hackers attack, companies use machine learning to analyze the attack so that they can understand how to counter it. If the attack is particularly malicious, company staff deal with it; If the attack is basic, they let the AI handle it, which allows it to grow in experience. AI, unlike staff, can more quickly respond to threats, which makes it all the more appealing by cybersecurity companies.</p>

Khan Academy uses such techniques in its programs, which uses pre-tests to figure out which lessons students have already mastered, are currently learning, or have no idea about. My Access by Vantage Learning uses algorithms to analyze and grade full scale essays from students on the basis of mechanics / conventions, focus, content, organization, and other categories. With greater introduction of AI in the online classroom, the dynamic between student and teacher is bound to change. AI will begin to eat up the annoying tasks of grading and analyzing coursework and tutors will be able to do what they do best, teach.</p>

			  		<p class="detailsText" id="titleDetailsText">In most factories, machines and robots are used to perform one action over and over again, which is an extremely efficient process as seen with the success of today’s consumer-oriented, mass production markets. With AI however, manufacturing can be even more efficient than it already it is, with an emphasis on smarter assembly. Element AI is currently creating AI that give recommendations for maintenance on assembly lines based on sensor technology. Creating automated robots to replace factory workers has been a concept thought about and proven numerous times over the years, however, such a proposal sparks debates over AI taking jobs from those that need it the most, which is why factories (mostly) do not do it yet.

Companies like NexLP provide lawyers AI that rapidly quicken this process, narrowing relevant documents and data based on concept rather than key words. Thus, lawyers can focus on creating their cases rather than parsing through unending piles of unstructured data. Some AI engines can even summarize conversations or articles, making story-building an even easier process. IBM’s Watson can be used to do similar data processing as well, however, in its case, lawyers can actually ask the bot to summarize new laws or regulations put into place as well as find data that indicate violations of such laws.</p>
